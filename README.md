A lightweight full-stack application that lets users instantly send a photo from their phone to their email.

Frontend: React (responsive design, file upload form)

Backend: Node.js / Express, using Multer for file processing

Email Service: Resend API integration for automated email delivery

Deployment: Hosted on Render

Designed for simplicity and real-world demonstration of RESTful API design, server-client communication, and environment configuration.

I needed my own domain to make it work properly (which I dont have) and cant spend the money on it so for now the app only sends emails to my email at mcosti105@gmail.com
